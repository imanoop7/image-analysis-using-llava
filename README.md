# Image Analysis Using LLaVA

Welcome to "Image-Analysis-Using-LLaVA", a project dedicated to exploring the capabilities of the LLaVA (Language and Vision Advanced Analysis) model in the realm of image analysis.

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize the LLaVA model to analyze images and extract meaningful information. The core of the project is the `app.py` script, which serves as the entry point for processing images using the LLaVA model.

## Features

- Image classification
- Object detection
- Pattern recognition
- Image captioning

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imanoop7/image-analysis-using-llava.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd image-analysis-using-llava

3. Run the app.py script to start analyzing images:
    ```bash
    python app.py
